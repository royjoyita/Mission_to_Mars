# Mission_to_Mars
Created a Jupyter Notebook file called mission_to_mars.ipynb and use this to complete all of your scraping and analysis tasks. 

Scraped the NASA Mars News Site and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text.

Used splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image.

Visited the Mars Facts webpage here and use Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc.

Visited the USGS Astrogeology site here to obtain high resolution images for each of Marâ€™s hemispheres.
